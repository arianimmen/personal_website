🌐 Personal Portfolio Website
This is the code for my personal portfolio site. It's a simple and clean space where I showcase who I am, what I do, and what I’m working on. I plan to expand it in the future with blog posts, tutorials, and other content related to IT, networking, and security.

🎨 Design Credit
The design is based 90% on this awesome Figma community template:

Huge thanks to the original designer for sharing such a clean and modern layout!
